# Exam Takes

The strategy is simple.

1. Learn more things about snowflake to pass the exam. (good for personal dev as well)
1. Take prep the exam
1. Correct my understanding about how snowflake works
1. repeat

This section we catalog our questions and answers from the prep exam taken, and **correct** the following in descending order of priority:
1. Questions I got incorrect
1. Questions I got correct for the incorrect reasons

1. I think the `INSERT_OVERWRITE` command is nifty, [see this](../../Course%20Material/section03_data_loading_and_unloading_worksheets/s03w04_INSERT&UPDATE.sql)
1. `Snowpipe` costing best understood as separate from `compute` and `storage` costs. [see this](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-billing)
